# Hello!
I studied at American University where I completed a PhD in Anthropology in 2020. I'm currently taking UX courses to further my knowledge. When I'm not working, I can be found dancing (in the pre-COVID-19 times), sewing, reading, learning Danish, and playing with my dog. I am also a co-founder and co-host of the _Women in Archaeology_ podcast with several of my colleagues.

Feel free to reach out!
