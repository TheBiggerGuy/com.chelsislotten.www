## Abstract
Utilizing skeletal remains from the Viking Age in Denmark, this dissertation seeks to
uncover how gender influenced lived experiences and identity formation during this period.
Historically, biases regarding the inherent abilities of individuals of either gender have heavily
influenced analysis in this area. Bioarchaeology offers a unique perspective on this query as
skeletons reflect an individual's life experiences and are a relatively unbiased source of
information about the past. As identity is performed through the manipulation of the human
body, analyzing the evidence of those experiences can provide a window into the past. Through
an analysis of Viking Age burials from across Denmark, I explore how gender impacted identity
formation and lived experience at the time. I utilize a bioarchaeological approach to discuss how
individuals were impacted by gendered expectations at the time. Through assessing activity
patterns, trauma prevalence rates, and the general health of individuals in the sample, patterns of
behavior that may shed light on lived experiences that impacted identity formation during the
Viking Age may be established. By combining that analysis with a discussion of the funerary
treatment of the deceased the interplay between the deceased's lived experiences and the social
status ascribed to them by the community who buried them can be assessed.

The results show that the relationship between ascribed social status and lived
experiences is complex and cannot be solely attributed to the influence of gender on individual
or social identity. The combination of skeletal and archaeological data help to provide a more
nuanced understanding of how gender historically impacted lived experience and identity
formation than either analysis could provide on its own.
