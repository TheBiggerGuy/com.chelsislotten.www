            <p class="lead">Chelsi Slotten is a PhD candidate in anthropology at American University. she received her BA from Tulane University in New Orleans where she studied human osteology, forensics, and the classics. She then went on to complete her MSc in paleopathology at Durham University in England. Her research there focused on recognizing victims of domestic abuse in the archaeological record and identifying social, religious, political, and economic factors contributing to different prevalence rates between urban and rural populations. Her current research interests include how gender influences bioarchaeology, nutritional access, health frailty, and trauma during the Viking Era.  Her dissertation analyzes how gender shaped individuals lived experiences during the Danish Viking Age.  She also has a passion for understanding with how the public engages with the past particularly at museums.</p>
